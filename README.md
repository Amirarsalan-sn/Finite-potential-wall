# Finite Potential Wall

In this project I've developed a program using python that simulates the behavior of a quantum particle in the Finite Potential Wall problem, a problem in which quantum tunneling is observed and we can see this phenomenon in practice via this simulation program.

It is easy to use the program. You just have to adjust the global variables at the top of the code to your desired value and run the main program, after that a video of the simulation will be saved in your computer.
